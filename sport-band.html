  <div class="project-description">
    <p> The goal of this project was to work collaboratively in a group to brainstorm and develop a product that was made primarily out of fabric and incorporated the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) microcontroller. After discussing several possibilities, our team settled on the idea of creating a wearable safety device. The device was a fabric-based sports band that could help make nighttime physical activities safer.

We focused on designing a hands-free lighting solution for late-night runners, walkers, and bikers. The final product was a noise-activated headlamp, built into a soft, stretchable band that could be comfortably worn around the head or arm. The idea was to allow the user to turn on their light simply by clapping or speaking near the device, without having to fumble with buttons or switches — a useful feature for those on the move.

On the technical side, we connected the CPX to a rechargeable iPhone battery pack, which allowed for portability and reuse. We configured the microphone on the CPX to detect sounds only within close range, ensuring that passing cars, wind, or other environmental noise wouldn't cause accidental activation.

This project gave us the opportunity to combine soft materials, wearable design, and microcontroller programming in a meaningful way. It also challenged us to think about real-world applications, user accessibility, and safety in both design and implementation. </p>
